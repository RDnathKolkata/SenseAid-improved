# PerceptaLucis™

## Abstract
PerceptaLucis™ is a smart assistive headwear designed which endeavours to potentially resolve, the lives of people with visual impairment, significantly so too. Aimed to help the misfortunate, this invention:

i.	Enhances Mobility for the Visually Impaired <br>
ii.	Increases Independence<br>
iii.	Offers an unprecedented level of Affordability to the Blind<br>

## Design (Hardware)
PerceptaLucis™ is a headgear that is mounted on the skull at the forehead, temples, and back region with cushioning for grip and comfort. It is annular in shape, with the hind portion being bulked to accommodate power storage. The front-end protrudes to make layout space for the primary processing and input devices. Secondary sensors are positioned at the edges of the device.

This system combines multiple ESP32 microcontrollers with AI-powered object detection to provide real-time navigation assistance through: 

A.	ESP32 Microprocessors <br>
B.	ESP32 CAM module <br>
C.	FTDI USB-to-Series Module <br>
D.	MPU 6050 <br>
E.	Power Supply Unit <br>
F.	Assorted Resistors <br>
G.	Ultrasonic Sensors <br>
H.	Flight-Time Sensors <br>
I.	Servo Motors <br>
J.	Vibration motors <br>
K.	Power banks <br>
L.	LED light of 5W.


## Functions (Software)
Vision Detection: YOLOv11-based object recognition <br>
Audio Alerts: Bluetooth audio feedback <br>
Haptic Feedback: Vibration motors for obstacle proximity <br>
Fall Detection: Emergency response system <br>
Distance Estimation: Accurate object distance calculation <br>


## Purpose
*This project exists to promote ethical, affordable accessibility technology for blind and visually impaired individuals.*
